# Make sure you have the correct chromedriver version installed if you want to run this program

Chromedriver can be found at https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads

After downloading the new chromedriver, just simply replace the executable with the new one.
Voila! This (hopefully) should work now.

If not, then you can change the path for the chromedriver in the Supplier.py file at the very bottom :)
