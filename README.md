# Python Inventory Checker Bot
some very basic python web scraping program that checks the availability of items when given the URLs of items. 
project was something to start learning webscraping with python and was something i did while i was bored and watching films so the program code is pretty messy and does not follow best practices.
also made it to try get a new gpu, which was the main incentive.

-- Update -- I cleaned it up a little just in case some recruiter comes along and spots this mess then I won't be written off straight away. Not taking any chances.</br> <sup><sub>Please hire me</sup></sub>\

# How to use
best used in Visual Studio Code terminal or a linux terminal as i have used pychalk for the command line output in order to make the output look pretty.
pychalk will not work in windows terminal - but VSC emulates a linux terminal so will work if executed VIA VSC. **File to execute will be InventCheck.py**.

Maybe i could make it run in a docker container instead if i decide to work on this again so that you don't need to execute VIA vsc.
Maybe i will, maybe i won't.
No promises.
