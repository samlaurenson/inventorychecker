# Python Inventory Checker Bot
some very basic python web scraping program that checks the availability of items when given the URLs of items. 
project was something to start learning webscraping with python and was something i did while i was bored and watching films so the program code is pretty messy and does not follow best practices.
also made it to try get a new gpu, which was the main incentive.

-- Update -- I cleaned it up a little just in case some recruiter comes along and spots this mess then I won't be written off straight away. Not taking any chances.</br> <sup><sub>Please hire me</sup></sub>\
<sup><sub>i promise i'm better than this</sup></sub>\
<sup><sub><sup>i think</sup></sup></sub>\
<sup><sub><sup><sub>i can get better</sup></sub></sup></sub>

# How to use
**File to execute will be InventCheck.py** <br>
Best either executing in VSC terminal or using the Windows Terminal so that pychalk colours will work and make the output readable.
